## About

<p>This project is dedicated to the development of a relational database, a structured repository designed to manage and correlate data seamlessly. Through this endeavor, the aim is to address the complexities associated with unstructured or loosely connected datasets by implementing a relational model that fosters logical relationships between different entities.</p>

<p>It proposes to organize our databases by storing them in directories. This directory-based structure
provides a clear and intuitive way to manage multiple databases, making it easier to locate and
maintain the relevant data. Each directory will represent a distinct database, and within each
database directory, the individual tables and associated files will be logically arranged.</p>

<p>To store the data within the relational database, It uses the widely adopted CSV (Comma-
Separated Values) file format. Each table in the database will be represented by a corresponding
CSV file, where rows represent individual records, and columns represent attributes. This format
is both human-readable and compatible with a multitude of data processing tools, ensuring ease
of use and interoperability.</p>

<p>Embracing the principles of the relational model, this database design will involve the creation of
tables that establish logical relationships between different entities. Each table will represent a
specific entity type (e.g., movies, actors, directors), and the relationships between tables will be
defined through keys. This relational approach not only enhances data integrity but also enables
efficient querying and analysis.</p>

<p>Final implementation will include a query language designed to interact with the relational
database. The query language will rely on keywords and follow a syntax inspired by standard
SQL (Structured Query Language) conventions. This choice ensures that users, even those
unfamiliar with complex database languages, can easily formulate queries using intuitive and
recognizable keywords. This approach aligns with the commitment to creating a user-friendly
database system.</p>
